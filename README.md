# 👋 Hello World! / 你好，世界！

As a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about backend architecture, I specialize in designing scalable systems using Java/Python with a strong emphasis on clean code principles. My coursework in distributed systems and database design has fueled my interest in microservices architecture and concurrent programming. Welcome to my technical blog where I share insights and experiences on backend architecture, system design, and programming practices.
